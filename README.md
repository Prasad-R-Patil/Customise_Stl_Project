# Customise STL Project

This project contains simple, custom-built versions of popular data structures found in the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). It is designed for learning and understanding how these data structures work internally by implementing them from scratch.

---

## 1. Overview

This project provides fundamental data structures implemented in C++ without relying on the Standard Template Library (STL). The goal is to demonstrate how these data structures function internally, enabling deeper understanding and better programming skills. The project includes implementations of:

- Singly Linked List (normal and circular)  
- Doubly Linked List (normal and circular)  
- Stack  
- Queue  
- Deque (double-ended queue)  
- Vector (dynamic array)  
- List  
- Basic algorithms for practice and illustration

---

## 2. Features

- Clean and easy-to-understand C++ implementations  
- Functions mimicking STL behavior for each data structure  
- Demonstrative demo programs for practical usage  
- Well-structured and modular header/source files  
- Suitable for beginners, students, and interview preparation  
- Easily extensible for further improvements or additions

## 3. Getting Started

### Requirements

- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`, `clang`)  
- A code editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks)  
- Basic knowledge of C++ programming and compilation

### Compilation Example

To compile a demo for the singly linked list, use the following command:

```bash
g++ -o demo singlylinearlldemo.cpp singlylinearlinkedlist.h
