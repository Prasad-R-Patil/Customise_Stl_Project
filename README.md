## 📝 Overview

This project includes custom implementations for:

- Singly Linked List (Linear and Circular)
- Doubly Linked List (Linear and Circular)
- Stack
- Queue
- Deque
- Vector
- List
- Basic Algorithms

Each data structure has its own `.h` header file and demo `.cpp` file to demonstrate its functionality.

## ✨ Features

- Custom implementations of STL-like containers
- Clear and modular code
- Simple demo programs for each structure
- Easy to understand for beginners
- Great for academic or interview preparation

## 🚀 Getting Started

- C++ Compiler (e.g., `g++`, `clang`)
- Basic understanding of C++ programming

### Compilation

To compile a demo, use:

```bash
g++ -o demo singlylinearlldemo.cpp singlylinearlinkedlist.h
